        1. Mount Everest, Himalayas, Nepal/Tibet Autonomous Region,
        China – 8848m. First climbed by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953,
        Mount Everest is,
        of course, the highest mountain in the world</p>

    <p id="para2" style="display: none;"> Mount Everest
        1.Mount Everest, located in Nepal and Tibet, is usually said to be the highest mountain on Earth.
        Reaching 29,029 feet at its summit,
        Everest is indeed the highest point above global mean sea level—the average level for the ocean surface from
        which elevations are measured</p>
    <p id="q3">Is Everest still growing?<button id="q33">show</button></p>
    <p id="para3" style="display: none;">
        The mountain was formed by the upward force generated when the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collided,
        pushing up the rocks that formed the highest mountain on Earth. That force is still at work today,
        pushing Everest's summit about a quarter of an inch higher each year.</p>
